Steps Followed - >


Task 1 - Load the files and remove blank rows 

- Download the Open refine and open it in the browser by running it from terminal.
- Load the uncleaned file (that is phm-collection.tsv) as new project 
- Use Facet and Filter ( that is beark down the data and filter it on specific filters)
- Go to Record id - Facet - Numerical Facet. (says No numeric data)
# So we need to convert string to interger 
- Rocord ID->  Edit Cells-> Common Tranform -> To numbers 
# notice on Graph there are two non numeric values 
# blank values (remove)
- GO to edit rows -> remove all matching value 

Task 2 - Remove duplicate rows

- To find the record id we need to sort the record id and then find the duplicates next to corresponding value 
- Record id -> Sort ->number, smallest first -> ok
#make the changes permanent 
- Sort -> Reorder rows permanently
# we use feature call blank cell (which leaves first and the rest duplicates to blank)
- Record id- > Edit cells ->Blank down. 
-> TO remove blank -> record id-> Facet -> Customize facet-> Facet by blank -> true -> edit rows -> remove all matching rows 

Task 3 - spelling error, incosistencies(capitalization)
-> Categories -> Edit cells-> Split mutli- valued cells -> Separator (|)
# so we are splitting everthing, we will clean it and re merge the categories . 
-> categories -> facet -> text facet (if required increase the limit to view the data)
# at the bottom we see blank (how many categories are blank)
# find similar categories, incosistencies in spelling 
->Cluster-> key collision -> Ngram Size (4) .....# to handle large phrases
-> unselect if something is not a proper match
-> ..... -> Merge Selected and recluster 
# now there are no incosistencies, so we are going to merge it as list 
-> Categories -> Join multivalued cells (|)-> ok 
Atomization - diving mutli valued cells into mutiple cells 
Back to same nows of rows with no row incositencies 
-> categories value -> Edit cells -> transform -> value.split('|').unique().join('|')-> ok
(expression)

Task 4 - Export the cleaned file 

-> Export and select tab seperated value as the initial value.
